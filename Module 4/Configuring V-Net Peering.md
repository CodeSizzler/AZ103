<h1>Configuring VNet peering and service chaining</h1>
<p>This lab is going to deal with Azure Virtual Network Peering. VNET peering is a concept of combining two different networks from same or different regions of Azure to become a single network for having an authenticated and secured access for resources. When we use VNET peering, the concept of creating VPN Gateways to connect different Azure Networks is not required since VNET Peering does the same thing for you in a cheaper and easier way.</p>

<h2>Demo Scenario:</h2>
This lab is about deployment of two Virtual Networks up on which a Virtual Machine will be deployed on one VNET and two virtual machines will be deployed up on another VNET in South India Datacenter. The deployment of resources will be carried out using ARM Templates. After the deployment is done, the VNETs will be peered for accessing the Virtual Machine that is of a different Virtual Network. To make this happen, we will also be deploying Routing Tables in Azure.</h2>

<h2>3.Configuring VNET Peering</h2>
<p>Once after the two VNETs are deployed in the previous two demos, you can start to peer the VENTs.Open the resource group that you created for first two VMs and open the VNET named az1000401-vnet1.</p>
<img src="https://codesizzlergit.blob.core.windows.net/az103-4-001/21.jpg"/>
<p>Navigate to the Peerings menu blade of that VNET and click on + Add button.</p>
<img src="https://codesizzlergit.blob.core.windows.net/az103-4-001/22.jpg"/>
<p>Give a valid name and choose the Peer details as shown below. For Virtual network choose the VNET named az1000402-vnet2 which you created in demo 2. Allow the Virtual network access and disable rest of the settings and click Ok.</p>
<img src="https://codesizzlergit.blob.core.windows.net/az103-4-001/23.jpg"/>
<p>You can note that peering got initialized in the VNET.</p>
<img src="https://codesizzlergit.blob.core.windows.net/az103-4-001/24.jpg"/>
<p>You have to repeat the same process in VM2. Go the resource group you created in demo 2 and open the VNET named az-1000402-vnet2.</p>
<img src="https://codesizzlergit.blob.core.windows.net/az103-4-001/25.jpg"/>
<p>Navigate to the Peerings blade of the VNET and click on + Add button to configure peering with another VNET.</p>
<img src="https://codesizzlergit.blob.core.windows.net/az103-4-001/26.jpg"/>
<p>Give a valid name and choose the Peer details as shown below. For Virtual network choose the VNET named az1000401-vnet1 which you created in demo 2. Allow the Virtual network access and disable rest of the settings and click Ok.</p>
<img src="https://codesizzlergit.blob.core.windows.net/az103-4-001/27.jpg"/>
<p>You can note that peering got initialized in the VNET.</p>
<img src="https://codesizzlergit.blob.core.windows.net/az103-4-001/28.jpg"/>

<h2>4.Configuring IP Forwarding and Creating Routing Table</h2>
<p>Go to virtual machines menu and find the VM named az1000401-vm2 for enabling IP Forwarding.</p>
<img src="https://codesizzlergit.blob.core.windows.net/az103-4-001/29.jpg"/>
<p>Go to the Networking blade and click on the NIC named az1000401-nic2 as shown below.</p>

<img src="https://codesizzlergit.blob.core.windows.net/az103-4-001/32.jpg"/>
<p>Give a name for the routing table and choose a subscription and resource group. Make sure to choose the location as South India, Disable Virtual network gateway propagation and click on Create.</p>
<img src="https://codesizzlergit.blob.core.windows.net/az103-4-001/33.jpg"/>
<p>Open the routing table after it gets deployed and navigate to its Routes blade and click on + Add button.</p>
<img src="https://codesizzlergit.blob.core.windows.net/az103-4-001/34.jpg"/>
<p>Give a name to the route and give its address prefix as 10.104.0.0/16 which is the address range of VNET az1000401-vnet1. For Next hop type select Virtual appliance and to the Next hop address set the IP address as 10.104.1.4 which is the IP address of the NIC of az1000401vm2 and click on Ok.</p>
<img src="https://codesizzlergit.blob.core.windows.net/az103-4-001/35.jpg"/>
<p>In a while, you will be able to find the Newly added route.</p>

<img src="https://codesizzlergit.blob.core.windows.net/az103-4-001/68.jpg"/>
<p>Now, let us go to the Local Server Manager and open Firewall settings. To do so, go to Tools and choose Windows Firewall with Advanced Security.</p>
<img src="https://codesizzlergit.blob.core.windows.net/az103-4-001/69.jpg"/>
<p>In the firewall window, go to Inbound Rules and enable File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request â€“ ICMPV4-In) rule by clicking on Enable Rule option.</p>
<img src="https://codesizzlergit.blob.core.windows.net/az103-4-001/70.jpg"/>

<h2>6.Validating Service Chaining</h2>
<p>Navigate to the VM menu once again and make RDP access to the VM az1000401-vm1 and open the local server manager and repeat same steps that you did earlier for enabling the Firewall rule. To do so, go to Tools and choose Windows Firewall with Advanced Security.</p>
<img src="https://codesizzlergit.blob.core.windows.net/az103-4-001/71.jpg"/>

<h2>7.Testing the Service Chaining between Peered Networks</h2>
<p>We have all set with the VNET Peering and configuration of VMs to allow connections via routes. Let us test the Peering now by making RDP to the VM az1000402-vm3 and open PowerShell and run the below given command. In the command, the IP address 10.104.0.4 is the IP address of the NIC of az1000401-vm1. On a successful execution of the command it is clear that we have routed the request between two networks.</p>
	<p>Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 10.104.0.4 -TraceRoute		</p>
<img src="https://codesizzlergit.blob.core.windows.net/az103-4-001/73.jpg"/>
<p>Here we have implemented the concept of VNET Peering and Service Chaining in Azure for routing the user traffic between two different networks in Azure.</p>
